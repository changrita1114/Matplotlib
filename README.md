> Three conclusions:
> (1) 249 mice were included in the current study. According to the summary statistics, the mean of the tumor volume was smallest when the mice were treated with Ramicane.
> (2) Accroding to the box plot, there was no outlier of the averaged tumor volume in four different drug regimens.
> (3) When the mice were treated with Capomulin, the weight and the averaged tumor volume were highly correlated, r = .49. In regression analysis, the weight could be a predictive factor for the tumor volumes. The higher the weight, the higher the averaged tumor volume could be predicted according to the formula.
